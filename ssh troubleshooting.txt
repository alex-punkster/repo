Before starting a troubleshooting, we suppose that internet connection is OK, the server has Ubuntu OS on board and SSH connection had worked before.
1. At first, check ping to the server. If it's ok, go to the next step. Otherwise, check a VPN connection (if used)
2. Make sure, that login and password are correct
3. Check firewall settings on laptop and allow SSH connection if need
4. Connect to the server console and check if the SSH client installed and works properly: write a command "service ssh status". If status is Inactive, then write a command "service ssh start"
5. Check your root user account rights to connect via SSH: in the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config variable "PermitRootLogin" should be turned to "yes"
6. Check the SSH port by writting a command grep Port /etc/ssh/sshd_config, default ssh port is 22. Than check if this port is listened: lsof -i:22
